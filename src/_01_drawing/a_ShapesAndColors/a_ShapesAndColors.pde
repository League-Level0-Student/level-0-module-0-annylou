// 1. Run this empty program 
// The grey square that appears has sides that are 100 pixels long

// 2. Code a size command to make it big enough for your picture

//    The size command looks like this:      
  size (600,500);
//    Try putting different numbers in the parentheses.
//    See if you can figure out which number is the width, and which is the height


// 3. Now add an ellipse command to draw a circle. An ellipse is like an oval.

//    The ellipse command looks like this:

fill(#FF9900);
ellipse(300,300, 275,275);
ellipse(240,450, 40,60);
ellipse(360,450, 40,60);
ellipse(140,330, 50,30);
ellipse(460,330, 50,30);

//    The first 2 numbers specify where to draw it. They are the x and y co-ordinates of the center of the ellipse.
//    The third and fourth numbers are the size of the ellipse.
//    The width is specified before the height. If they are the same, it draws a circle
//    Change the numbers and re-run the program to see what happens.

// 4. Now add a rect command to draw a rectangle.

//    The rect command looks like this:  
fill(#7CD600);
triangle(226,182,150,160,170,251);
triangle(427,251,450,160,372,182);
triangle(226,182,261,103,297,161);
triangle(372,182,344,103,297,161);

fill(#81E7FF);
ellipse(338,390, 15,30);
//    Like the ellipse, the fist 2 numbers specify where to draw it, the other two are its size.
//    The main difference is the x and y co-ordinates are the top left corner of the shape.
//    If the width is the same as the height, it draws a square.

fill(#000000);
ellipse(250,324, 15,15);
ellipse(350,324, 15,15);
ellipse(225,240, 110,100);
ellipse(295,240, 110,100);
ellipse(375,240, 110,100);
ellipse(295,180, 200,60);
rect(163,322, 50,5);
rect(213,297, 5,50);
rect(213,295, 70,5);
rect(278,295, 5,50);
rect(284,322, 30,5);
rect(314,299, 5,50);
rect(314,295, 70,5);
rect(379,299, 5,50);
rect(384,322, 52,5);
rect(213,345, 70,5);
rect(314,345, 70,5);
rect(260,373, 80,3);



// 5. Now add color to your shapes. If you don't they will all be white.
//    Processing provides a Color Selector Tool to make it easy to choose colors.
//    Find the Processing Tools menu (ask your teacher for help if you can't locate it)
//    Once you have opened the Color Selector, pick the color you want then press the Copy button.

//    Color is added with the fill command that looks like this:       fill(  );

//    Paste the code for your selected color between the parentheses.
//    It should now look something like this (the code will be different):   

// 6. The next shape you draw will be in the color you selected. 
//    NOTE: You have to put the fill command with the color you want, 
//    BEFORE you draw the shape.

// 7. Now use all these shapes and colors to draw a picture of your own design. 

// MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR CODE
